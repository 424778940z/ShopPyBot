# ShopPyBot Refactor

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring process and the current status of the ShopPyBot project. The goal of the refactor is to modernize and optimize the codebase, making it more maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

## Initial Goals
1. **Code Structure and Organization**
   - Modularize the Code
   - Configuration Management

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Multi-threading/Multiprocessing
   - Asynchronous Programming

3. **Selenium Enhancements**
   - Headless Browsing
   - Browser Automation Alternatives
   - Error Handling and Recovery

4. **Security and Data Privacy**
   - Obscure Sensitive Data
   - Logging and Monitoring

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Virtual Environments
   - Dependency Updates

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Unit Testing
   - Integration Testing
   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

7. **Documentation and Maintainability**
   - Code Documentation
   - User Documentation
   - Code Reviews

8. **Future-Proofing**
   - Scalability
   - Modular Design

## Current Status

### Completed ✅
1. **Code Structure and Organization**
   - ✅ Modularized the code into `amazon_bot.py`, `bestbuy_bot.py`, `config.py`, `logger.py`, `utils.py`, and `main.py`.
   - ✅ Configuration management using `config.yml` and `PyYAML`.

2. **Security and Data Privacy**
   - ✅ Obscured sensitive data by storing it in `config.yml`.
   - ✅ Implemented robust logging using `writeLog`.

3. **Selenium Enhancements**
   - ✅ Improved error handling in functions.
   - ✅ Implemented automatic downloading of the latest ChromeDriver using `webdriver_manager`.

4. **Driver Management**
   - ✅ Ensured the driver is reinitialized after each iteration to maintain a fresh browser session.

### In Progress ⚠️
1. **Documentation and Maintainability**
   - ⚠️ Added some docstrings and comments.
   - ⚠️ Created this `refactor.md` document.
